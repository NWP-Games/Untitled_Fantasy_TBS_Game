5) click on the "Untitled Fantasy TBS Game" executable to begin playing

This Demo consists of 10 Levels, 5 Main Levels and 5 Side Levels. The Main Levels require the Hero Unit, while the Side Levels each require a different unit as listed in their level description. If you lose a level, or choose to retreat from a level, you can replay the level, in future versions of the game this won't be the case. Also if you lose a unit during a level you will still have access to them in future levels, in future versions of the game there will be unit permadeath.
