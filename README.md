5) click on the "Untitled Fantasy TBS Game" executable to begin playing

This Demo consists of 10 Levels, 5 Main Levels and 5 Side Levels. The Main Levels require the Hero Unit, while the Side Levels each require a different unit as listed in their level description. If you lose a level, or choose to retreat from a level, you can replay the level, in future versions of the game this won't be the case. Also if you lose a unit during a level you will still have access to them in future levels, in future versions of the game there will be unit permadeath.

Demo 0.1.2 added in some bug fixes with the prior version, includes: Fixed Escape Action always available on Escape Levels; Fixed Escape Action appearing sometimes during Survive Levels; Fixed Bug with Hero Heal Action; Fixed Bug with Healer Attack Action; Fixed Bug Ranged Attacks through closed doors; Units Unselect after swapping positions; and Updated Pit Color to be more distinguishable.
